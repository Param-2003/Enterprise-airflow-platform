## 🚀 Quick Start (Student Edition)

### 🎓 Local Development Setup

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Param-2003/enterprise-airflow-platform.git
   cd enterprise-airflow-platform
   
   # Copy student-friendly config
   cp .env.student .env
   # No need to edit - pre-configured for local development
   ```

2. **Start Everything (One Command!)**
   ```bash
   # This starts everything with minimal resource usage
   make student-setup
   
   # Or step by step:
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access Your "Enterprise" Platform**
   - 🌐 Airflow UI: http://localhost:8080 (admin/admin)
   - 📊 Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
   - 🔍 Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - 💾 PgAdmin: http://localhost:5050 (admin@admin.com/admin)

4. **Verify Everything Works**
   ```bash
   make health-check
   # Should show all services as healthy
   ```

### 🔄 In a Real Enterprise (What This Would Look Like):

```bash
# Enterprise deployment would be:
terraform plan -var-file="production.tfvars"  # Plan infrastructure
terraform apply                               # Deploy to AWS/GCP/Azure
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/              # Deploy to Kubernetes
helm install airflow apache-airflow/airflow  # Use Helm charts
```

**💡 Learning Note**: We simulate this with Docker Compose locally, but the concepts and structure are identical to what enterprises use.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (Student Common Issues)

### 🎓 Common Student Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "Not enough memory" errors
```bash
# Solution: Optimize for student hardware
make student-mode       # Starts with minimal resource usage
docker-compose -f docker-compose.student.yml up -d
```

**Issue**: Containers keep crashing
```bash
# Debug steps
docker-compose ps       # Check container status
docker-compose logs     # See error messages
make health-check       # Run diagnostic
```

**Issue**: "Port already in use"
```bash
# Solution: Change ports in .env.student
AIRFLOW_WEB_PORT=8081
GRAFANA_PORT=3001
# Or stop conflicting services
```

**Issue**: DAGs not appearing
```bash
# Quick fix
docker-compose exec airflow-webserver airflow dags list-import-errors
make refresh-dags
```

### 💡 Learning Opportunities from Issues

**When things break** (and they will):
1. **Read the logs**: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
2. **Check resource usage**: `docker stats`
3. **Verify connectivity**: `docker-compose exec service ping another-service`
4. **Database troubleshooting**: Connect directly to PostgreSQL
5. **Network issues**: Inspect Docker networks

**🎯 These troubleshooting skills are exactly what employers look for in DevOps and platform engineering roles.**
